Room Acoustics Impulse Response Generator using the Randomized Image Method (RIM)

If you use this code please cite: 

E. De Sena, N. Antonello, M. Moonen, and T. van Waterschoot, "On the Modeling of
Rectangular Geometries in Room Acoustic Simulations", IEEE Transactions of Audio, Speech
Language Processing, vol. 21, no. 4, April 2015.

A single channel MATLAB implementation of the RIM can be found in:
http://www.desena.org/sweep/

A less efficient MATLAB multi-channel version can be found here in the MATLAB folder with the same code structure as the Julia version.

Notice that instead of moving the source on a line as in the paper, here we are moving the source 
in a cube with (2 Rd) edge.
