Room acoustics impulse response generator using the Randomized Image Method (RIM)

## Installation

To install the package, hit `]` from the Julia command line to enter the package manager, then

```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/nantonel/RIM.jl.git
```

## Usage 

Import the package by typing `using RIM`. 
First you need to specify an acoustic environment 
and sampling frequency: 
```julia
using RIM
Fs = 8e3          # sampling frequency
env = AcEnv(Fs)   # create new acoustic env with default values
```
by default the speed of sound is chosen to be 343 m/s.
You can change this using `AcEnv(Fs,c)`
where `c` is the speed of sound you want.
Create the geometry of the room  by typing: 
```julia
Lx,Ly,Lz = 4.,5.,3.;
T60 = 0.7;
geo = CuboidRoom(Lx,Ly,Lz,T60,env);
```
where `Lx`,`Ly`,`Lz` are the room 
dimensions in meters and `T60` 
is the desired reverberation time. 
If the reverberation time is specified, all the walls will 
have the same reflection coefficient β.
Alternatively this can be manually set 
by specifying 6 element array:
```julia
β = [0.9;0.9;0.7;0.7;0.8;0.8]; #[   βx1    ;    βx2   ;    βy1   ;    βy2    ;  βz1 ;   βz2  ]
                               #[front wall; rear wall; left wall; right wall; floor; ceiling]
geo = CuboidRoom(Lx,Ly,Lz,β);
```
You can also use frequency 
dependent reflection coefficients 
by means of an IIR filter.
```julia
b = [0.64;  -0.78;   0.14] 
a = [ 1.0;  -1.43;   0.44]
NT = 100;                       #number of samples for which the convolution with IIR is truncated
geo = CuboidRoomFD(Lx,Ly,Lz,b,a,NT);
```
Notice that frequency dependent 
reflection coefficients 
lead to simulations that are 
more computationally expensive.

Once the properties of the room are given, 
select your source and 
microphone positions:
```julia
xs = [0.5 0.5 0.5]';                    #src pos (in meters)
xr = [Lx-0.1 Ly-0.3 Lz-0.2; 2. 2. 2.]'; #mic pos
Nt = round(Int64,Fs/2);                 #time samples (1/5 sec)
```
Now type:
```julia
h = rim(xs,xr,Nt,geo,env);
```
to obtain your room impulse response.

You can also use multiple sound sources.
Say you have two sound sources with positions:
```julia
xs1 = [0.5 0.5 0.5]';      #src 1 pos (in meters)
xs2 = [0.5 0.75 0.5]';     #src 2 pos (in meters)
xr = [Lx-0.1 Ly-0.3 Lz-0.2; 2. 2. 2.]'; #mic pos
```
specify their signals:
```julia
Nt = round(Int64,Fs/2);                 #time samples (1/5 sec)
s1 = randn(Nt);                         #src 1 signal 
s2 = randn(Nt);                         #src 2 signal
```
and type:
```julia
p = rim([s1 s2],[xs1 xs2],xr,Nt,geo,env);
```
to compute the sound pressure 
generated by these two sound sources.

## Changing default parameters with Keyword Arguments


### `CuboidRoom`


The function `CuboidRoom` has the default additional parameters: 

* `Rd = 1e-2`: random displacement of image sources.
* `Sr`: seed of the randomization which by default is a random integer.

One can change this by typing:
```julia
CuboidRoom(Lx,Ly,Lz,T60,env; Rd = myRd, Sr = mySr)
```
or 
```julia
CuboidRoom(Lx,Ly,Lz,β; Rd = myRd, Sr = mySr)
```

### `CuboidRoomFD`


The function `CuboidRoomFD` has the same default additional parameters as `CuboidRoom`. 


### `rim`


The function `rim` has the default additional parameters:

* `N = [0;0;0]`      : 3 element `Array` representing order of reflection 
                                (set to [0;0;0] to compute full order).
* `Tw = 20`          : taps of fractional delay filter
* `Fc = 0.9`         : cut-off frequency of fractional delay filter

One can change this by typing:
```julia
rim(xs,xr,Nt,geo,env; N = myN, Tw = myTw, Fc = myFc)
```


## Other languages implementations

A single channel MATLAB implementation of the RIM can be found in:
[http://www.desena.org/sweep/](http://www.desena.org/sweep/)

A multi-channel MATLAB version can be found in this repository in the [src/MATLAB folder](https://github.com/nantonel/RIM.jl/tree/master/src/MATLAB). Notice that the Julia version outperforms both implementations in terms of speed.
